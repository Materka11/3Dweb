# 3Dweb
The project of my own website in 3d

The project model is made with a blender. The entire design is made with React Three Fiber.

Will be available on my page in the future so you can see him there.

if you just want to see it you can download Node.js and run the following commands:

  # Install dependencies (only the first time)
  npm install

  # Run the local server at localhost:8080
  npm start
